# Coding Challenge Alvaro Alday

This is a coding challenge for coodesh

## Installation

Generate a .env file

```bash
cp .env.sample .env
```

or by using docker-compose with the following commands

```bash
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d
```

After initializsing the docker environment you should have access to a postgres database and a server running in localhost:3000 in your host machine. No need to further change the .env file or .env file

## Running tests

Run the tests from the docker container

```bash
docker-compose exec app rspec
```

## Completion and Submission Instructions
1. Add the link to the repository with your solution to the task on the platform
2. Check if the Readme is good and make the final commit to your repository
3. Submit and wait for further instructions. If the test requires a video presentation, it will be possible to record it on the submission screen after adding the repository link. Good luck and success! =)

## Support

For questions about the process, send a message directly to a specialist in the platform chat.
